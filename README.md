'Walk Through' - 
Upon opening the program, you will be prompted with the main screen, of which the game will cycle to following the completion of each environment. Rolling the die, which spits out a number one through five, determines which environment you'll travel to. Number are indicative of difficulty, where one is the least difficult, and five is the most. Environment descriptions are listed below.

1: A simple meadow, with enemies of low difficulty, being slow and small. The concentration of food in the meadow is comparatively high.
2: In the flood environment, visibility is low, and enemies are mere shadows in against the water. As the sprite is not adapted to wet conditions, it is slow in comparison to the enemies.
3: The mudslide environment features slower, but considerably large enemies, of which blend into the background to a certain degree, seeing as though they're caked in mud. 
4: While similar to the meadow environment, the smog environment is blanketed with a thick layer of smog. Food is in abundance, but the enemies are considerably difficult to see, and to evade. Poor air conditions slow down your character.
5: In the famine environment, of which is the greatest difficulty, food is scarce, and enemies linger in large numbers. 

To roll, press 'r'. To continue, press the 'space bar'. Upon doing so, you'll be launched into the environment. The bars of the top left are indicative of the following.

Red: The red bar shows health, which is decreased when the sprite is damaged by an enemy. Note that enemies of which are smaller, or equal in size cannot inflict harm. When all health has diminished, you'll move onto the 'upgrades screen', which will be described in the following section.
Yellow: The yellow bar fills itself, and is indicative of the 'sprint' cooldown. Sprinting, which more closely resembed a teleport, can be used by pressing the 'space bar' while in game. It will propel the sprite forward. When consumed, the yellow bar will reset, then slowly fill. Again, when it's full, the sprint can be used.
Green: The green bar, of which is greatly important, shows how close a sprite is to completing the level. Sitting on the food will fill the bar, which must reach its plateau prior to a player moving onto the following environment.

When the 'green bar' has been filled (recall that the 'green bar' is filled when a sprite consumed food.), or the sprite has been slain, the player will progress to the 'upgrades' screen. If you have successfully cleared the level, you have gained a 'power', which allows for a sprite to be upgraded. Clicking each labeled button will increase that of the sprite (Ie. clicking 'size' will increase the sprite's size.). When finished, press 'c' to continue. Again, you'll be prompted with the roll screen, and you're able to repeat the steps of the game as detailed above. Upon completion of the final level, you're able to click the right hand corner 'exit' button. 

Controls - 
Arrow keys: The arrow keys are responsible for the translational movement of the sprite
Space: When in the game, the 'space bar' will propel the sprite forward (Assuming the 'yellow bar' has been filled.).
